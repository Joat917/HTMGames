### Why Here on Github?

I wrote some mini games in html in order to play them on my iphone, where visualized libs for python are not available, and the games on app store are all limited from underages in my region. (to protect the so-called "healthy growth of teenagers", I guess, and to encourage fierce involution for an entry ticket to top universities) 

However, I'm finding it hard to run these javascripted html files on the phone. The default preview of html files didn't provide any js support (or at least I didn't find a way to turn it on). 

So I resort to remote servers so that I can run the pages in browsers. Github is the ideal place to put up a page online and request it whenever and wherever I want. It is the also most suitable place for a code file to settle and develop and make itself useful. 

Now, this repo is not only a place for the games coded by myself, but it also contains useful tools concerning the school and the major I'm in, and some experimental html pages which record my spark of curiosity. I hope it will be useful for other people.
