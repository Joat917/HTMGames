*(Although it doesn't exist, I'll eventually finish it out... --Oct.24,2024)*

### Why Here on Github?

I wrote some mini games in html in order to play them on my iphone, 
where visualized libs for python are not available, 
and the games on app store are all limited from underages in my region
to preserve the so-called "healthy growth of teenagers". *(To encourage fierce involution)*

However, I'm finding it hard to run these javascripted html files on the phone.

To do this, I must upload the html files onto a server and request it via url, 
which is exactly why this repo comes into existence.

Github is the best place I have ever found to place something on the cloud 
and to be requested whenever and wherever I want. 
It is the also most suitable place for a code file to settle and develop and make itself useful. 

### What's Inside?

Only Htm files and their corresponding css and js files.

- `./GlowingCornerHoverEffect.htm` When you put your mouse on the shapes, there are amazing lights shed on it. 
- `./MswHtm.htm` Minesweeper game with the worst experience. Believe me, you'll get mad about it. *(Try https://minesweeper.cn instead)*

1. Some files are not yet available. I'll add them later.
2. I haven't yet resorted to AI for help, so let me think over it...
